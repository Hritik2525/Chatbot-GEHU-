# Chatbot-GEHU-
This is a chatbot I made for Graphic Era Hill University.
Instructions:
1. To start you can download the repository and put all files into the same folder.
2. Download the following libraries for python;
   >PyTorch
   >NLTK
3. Then run 'nltk.download('punkt')' in the console to download the 'punkt' package for 'nltk' library.
4. Then to run the code, first step is to run the 'train.py' file.
5. After its running is completed run the 'app.py' file to open the chatbot GUI and start using the chatbot. 
[You can change the data of 'knowledge_base.json' file to change the bot's responses and then run 'train.py' to create any kind of chatbot you want.]
